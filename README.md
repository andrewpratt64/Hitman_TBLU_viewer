# TBLU viewer

TBLU viewer is a javaFX application made to view the TBLU files found in the HITMANâ„¢: World of Assasination series.



# usage

Run **TBLUViewer.jar** and select a .TBLU file.

The application can be configured inside of the setting.txt.
The settings.txt has the following settings:

### Level of detail: <0 ~ 11>
This defines how "deep" into the Treeview you can look. 
> Setting this too high can result in a stackOverflow.

### use old jsons: <true/false>
Checks if file to load has already been decoded and uses this data to build the treeview.
Decreases load time due to the application not having to decode the TBLU file.

### enable popups: <true/false>
enables the popups that show up if an item with linked arrays is clicked.

# internal workings

TBLUviewer uses a Python script to decode the TBLU files. After decoding the file the scripts ouput is interpretetdby a JavaFX application that builds an ItemLibrary and displays its items inside a treeView.
